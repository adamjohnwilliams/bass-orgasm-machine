# bass-orgasm-machine

Congratulations! In this repository you'll find the software & information you need to build your very own Bass Orgasm Machine.

To run the tone generator (".pd" file) you will need to install Pure Data. It is free & open source, head to https://puredata.info/ to download it for whatever OS you like, or if you wish to use it on a mobile device then check out http://droidparty.net/ for Android or http://danomatika.com/code/pdparty for iOS.

Any suitably powerful speaker that's nice & bassy should do fairly well, however bear in mind that the Bass Orgasm Machine outputs both sound & infrasound, and if used without the appropriate care & attention it is quite easy to blow up amplifiers or destroy speaker drivers with it. I recommend experimenting with bassrolle or bandpass-type car subwoofers to start, or constructing a reseonator from scratch. I of course accept no responsibility for any damage to speakers or other equipment resulting from the use of this software, but if we meet IRL and you tell me your tale, perhaps I'll buy you a beer.

More speaker info coming soon

Much love,

Rev. Dr. Chemical Adam
